              <p>I am a senior at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies Field with a focus on Social Media and Isolation. My specialized fields are Sociology, Psychology, and Anthropology, all with connections to Technology and Social Media. My focus of Research and Thesis is the effects of social media use on modern human interactions, specifically the isolation created by our constant needs of instant gratification and virtual community acceptance.</p>

<p>I care deeply about others’ well-being; my major, research paper, and job experiences reflect this.
It took me a while to figure out what I truly want to do. My journey started with art, then I ventured out to marketing, after that I shifted my focus on UX/UI, but project management truly captures my personality and the things I’m passionate about: taking charge, connecting with people, and using my attention to detail as an advantage.</p>

<p>My passion for design began with the Fine Arts. I studied different mediums throughout high school and college, but acrylic paint has always been my favorite. It requires smart planning and fast execution, a workstyle that suits me. Learning to express ideas effectively through art is a skill that has allowed me the honor of having my paintings hung in the Capitol Building in Sacramento. To combine my passion to give back and designing skills, I created three original designs for #HappyPeriodBerkeley for their stickers and pins sale events as an effort to raise menstrual health awareness; all profits went towards helping homeless shelters.</p>

<p>My fine arts background not only qualifies me as a graphic designer, but also provides me an invaluable understanding of open mindedness. The years I have spent on studying and evaluating artworks and artists throughout history provide me the necessary ability to keep an open mind, as the beauty of art is subjective both in the creator and the audience’s mind. Having a trained impartial mind from a fine arts background would allow me to provide the necessary skills of an effective Project Manager to manage both the people I work with and the clients, including personal and professional presence, with minimal to no bias.</p>

<p>My open-mindedness comes with a desire to express myself and for others to express themselves freely. Immigrating from Vietnam at a young age, I have come to value an open mind and acceptance towards others.</p>
